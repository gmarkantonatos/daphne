This code is orphaned! The science project that we used it for switched back to 
matlab, so we are no longer reading TDMS files from C++. The code should be usable as 
is. If anyone wants to work on it or maintain it feel free to take it. You can contact
me (john.shumwayjr) with any questions. I'd be happy to help out if I knew that 
someone found it useful.
